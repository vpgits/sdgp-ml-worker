It is a mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object’s component. Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.\n• Inheritance\nInheritance allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class. In other words, the derived class inherits the states and behaviors from the base class.\n• Polymorphism.\nPolymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.[/INST] ### Output :"
